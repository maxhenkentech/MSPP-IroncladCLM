# Ironclad CLM Custom Connector Documentation

## Introduction

The Ironclad CLM Custom Connector is a powerful integration tool designed to seamlessly connect PowerPlatform with IroncladCLM. This connector enables users to interact with workflows, records, users, and groups within Ironclad, providing a robust set of operations for managing contracts and related processes. The connector and it's actions are available in Power Automate, Copilot Studio and PowerApps, tough the latter two with some limitations.

Key features of this connector include:

- Comprehensive support for workflow management
- Extensive record manipulation capabilities
- User and group administration through SCIM protocol
- Dynamic interaction with Ironclad's API, enhanced by a custom script for improved compatibility

The custom script included in this connector plays a crucial role in transforming API traffic, making the fundamentally non-OpenAPI compatible Ironclad API work seamlessly with OpenAPI standards and therefore MS PowerPlatform. This script executes at runtime, enabling users to interact dynamically with their workflows and records, thus significantly enhancing the connector's functionality and user experience.

## Supported Endpoints

>**Note**: Endpoints that are affected by scripts return transformed properties that may look or behave differently to the official [Ironclad API Reference](https://developer.ironcladapp.com/reference/getting-started-api) documentation. This is to ensure compatibility with the OpenAPI standard. For some of the endpoints, you will find examples of use towards the end of this document. They are indicated with * in the table below.

## Authentication

The Ironclad CLM Custom Connector uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. To use this connector, you'll need to register an OAuth client application with Ironclad and obtain the necessary credentials. Here's how to do it:

### Registering an OAuth Client in Ironclad

1. Log in to your Ironclad account.
2. Click on your user profile dropdown at the top right-hand corner and select "Company Settings".
3. Select the "API" tab on the left sidebar.

   > **Note**: The "API" tab will only be visible if you have the API add-on enabled for your instance.

4. Click on the "Create new app" button.
5. In the popup, enter a name for your OAuth application and click "Create app".
6. You will be provided with a client ID and secret. Save these securely, as you won't be able to access the secret again.
7. After closing the modal, fill out the client application details:
   - Title: This will appear in the Authorization Code Grant consent dialog.
   - Description
   - Display Image: This will appear in the Authorization Code Grant consent dialog.
   - Grant Types: Select the eligible OAuth grants for this client - by default, this should be set to "Authorization Code".
   - Redirect URIs: Enter the allowed URIs for the Authorization Code Grant. The URI for the use with Power Platform is "INSERT HERE ONCE KNOWN".
   - Requested Resource Scopes: Select the allowed resource scopes for this client application.

   > **Note**: For the custom connector to work as expected, check the scope table below and add them to your list of scopes in the registered application. The scopes public.records.readSchemas, public.workflows.readSchemas, scim.users.readUsers and scim.groups.readGroups need to be enabled for any scenario.

1. Click "Save Changes" to complete the registration.

### Environments

Ironclad operates in multiple environments:
- Production: ironcladapp.com (majority of customers)
- EU Production: eu1.ironcladapp.com (EU customers)
- Demo: demo.ironcladapp.com

Each environment operates independently. A client application generated on one environment will only work on that same environment. You'll need to create separate client applications for each environment you plan to use.

### Entering Credentials in the Custom Connector

When you first use the Ironclad CLM Custom Connector, you'll need to enter your credentials. Here's how:

1. When prompted to create a new connection, you'll see a dropdown to select the Ironclad instance you want to connect to (Demo, EU1, or Global).
2. After selecting the instance, you'll need to provide the following information:
   - Ironclad Client Id: Enter the client ID you received when registering your OAuth application.
   - Ironclad Client Secret: Enter the client secret you received when registering your OAuth application.
3. After entering these details, you'll be redirected to the Ironclad login page to authorize the connection.
4. Once authorized, the connector will use these credentials to authenticate API requests to Ironclad.

> Note: The connector uses different authentication endpoints based on the selected instance (demo.ironcladapp.com, eu1.ironcladapp.com, or ironcladapp.com). Make sure you're using the correct client ID and secret for the environment you're connecting to.


## Usage Examples

### Create a Workflow Synchronously

To accomplish this action in the connector, the script is transforming the response from the Retrieve Workflow Schema endpoint to display the launch form fields dynamically. To display them, you first have to select the workflow configuration you would like to launch to retrieve the fields. Because of this, it is not possible to "Enter a custom value" for this field.

### Update Approval on a Workflow

As the Retrieve Workflow Schema endpoint does not retrieve information about  approver roles that are not present in the form, this action requires you to select a workflow that was already launched to retrieve the applicable schema.

To configure this action:

1. Select a workflow from the dropdown list that was already launched with the same workflow configuration and wait for the approval roles to appear in the form;
2. Enter the relevant field values for the approvers, as if you were configuring this for a future workflow; and
3. Replace the workflow value with your dynamic value. You will notice the field labels being converted to system property names. This is normal and your action will execute successfully.

### Create a Record

The Ironclad repository data model support attaching any property to any record. As such, displaying a full dynamic list of properties is not feasible, as the action form would contain all properties in your instance. As such, record properties can be attached in the action form as an array. The script will then convert the content of the form to the schema supported by the Ironclad api. In MS Power Platform, custom connector must have an explicit data type associate with each schema. This means that you must provide a complex representation of your property value. See below for formatting examples for each Ironclad data type.

| Data Type       | Natural Representation                                                 | Complex Representation                                             |
